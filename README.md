# Code to Generate Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity Charts
*Adapted from https://github.com/manu-mannattil/vachart, https://github.com/shaanbhambra/CAS_Snellen_VA_Chart AND https://github.com/brendanktao/ETDRS_CASandLatin*

This repository contains Python scripts and LaTeX templates for generating Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity charts, in both Latin characters and Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (CAS). These charts can be used for testing contrast sensitivity in a standardized manner and are adaptable for various testing scenarios.
